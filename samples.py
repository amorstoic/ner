    "Meditation and Aceite de Moska.\nI love ending a long day of work with a transition moment.\n Usually this happens by meditating while I let our Aceite de Moska scalp treatment oil work its magic.\nI usually keep it on for about 15 minutes before washing off, and let it become the perfect transition moment for me to squeeze in a meditation.\n The scent of the oil helps me relax, just what I need after a long day.\n Try our new product and tell us how we are doing.

    "Getting relaxed by cooking and listening to music.\nA comforting activity that gets my mind from work mode into downtime is cooking.\nI have a new-found passion for cooking since I’ve been breastfeeding, as my hunger has completely peaked.\n Chopping vegetables for a big stew while listening to Spotify’s Bossa Nova Dinner playlist is truly meditative for me.\n I also love making myself a Ghia non-alcoholic aperitivo to enjoy a nice cocktail while cooking.",
